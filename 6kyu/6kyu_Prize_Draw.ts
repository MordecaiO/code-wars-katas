/*
To participate in a prize draw each one gives his/her firstname.

Each letter of a firstname has a value which is its rank in the English alphabet. A and a have rank 1, B and b rank 2 and so on.

The length of the firstname is added to the sum of these ranks hence a number som.

An array of random weights is linked to the firstnames and each som is multiplied by its corresponding weight to get what they call a winning number.

Example:
names: "COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH"
weights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]

PauL -> som = length of firstname + 16 + 1 + 21 + 12 = 4 + 50 -> 54
The *weight* associated with PauL is 2 so PauL's *winning number* is 54 * 2 = 108.
Now one can sort the firstnames in decreasing order of the winning numbers. When two people have the same winning number sort them alphabetically by their firstnames.

Task:
parameters: st a string of firstnames, we an array of weights, n a rank

return: the firstname of the participant whose rank is n (ranks are numbered from 1)

Example:
names: "COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH"
weights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]
n: 4

The function should return: "PauL"
